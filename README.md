T1: twp .py files: 
-p1.1_plot.py reads the files and generates the distribution plot
-p1.1_clf.py implements the Naive Bayes classifier. 

T2: Seven .py files
-p1.2_plot.py to generate the distribution 
-for the rest of the files, each file corresponds to the implementation of a specific method i.e GNB, base-dt, etc.
these files also contain the caldulation of the average and std accuracy mac-ave-f1 and w-ave-f1. 

To show the metrics: 
1-comment out the section related to the average and std values at the bottom of the file.
2-Run the code

To find the averaeg and std values:
1-Run the code and record the values of average accuracy mac-ave-f1 and w-ave-f1 to the lists correspondin to them
2- Uncomment the lists, average and std calculators as well as the print sections corresonding to them and run the code
